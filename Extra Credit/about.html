<h2>About Bloom</h2>

<h3>I created this website for extra credit! I enjoy the html side of code much more that the other side becasue I am more interested in the creative side. Like what a website looks like and what the consumer feels when they use it.</h3>

<h3>I selected this topic for my site becasue I am obsessed with all things floral. Flowers are my favorite because they are just so beautiful.</h3>
